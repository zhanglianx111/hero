### Running Multi-Node Kubernetes Using Docker

_Note_:
These instructions are somewhat significantly more advanced than the [single node](docker.md) instructions.  If you are
interested in just starting to explore Kubernetes, we recommend that you start there.

## Overview
This guide will set up a 2-node kubernetes cluster, consisting of a _master_ node which hosts the API server and orchestrates work
and a _worker_ node which receives work from the master.  You can repeat the process of adding worker nodes an arbitrary number of
times to create larger clusters.

Here's a diagram of what the final result will look like:

### Bootstrap Docker
This guide also uses a pattern of running two instances of the Docker daemon
   1) A _bootstrap_ Docker instance which is used to start system daemons like ```flanneld``` and ```etcd```
   2) A _main_ Docker instance which is used for the Kubernetes infrastructure and user's scheduled containers

This pattern is necessary because the ```flannel``` daemon is responsible for setting up and managing the network that interconnects
all of the Docker containers created by Kubernetes.  To achieve this, it must run outside of the _main_ Docker daemon.  However,
it is still useful to use containers for deployment and management, so we create a simpler _bootstrap_ daemon to achieve this.

## Master Node
The first step in the process is to initialize the master node.

See [here](docker-multinode/master.md) for detailed instructions.

## Adding a worker node

Once your master is up and running you can add one or more workers on different machines.

See [here](docker-multinode/worker.md) for detailed instructions.

## Testing your cluster

Once your cluster has been created you can [test it out](docker-multinode/testing.md)
